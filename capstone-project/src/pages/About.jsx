        <p className="paragraph">Bertha’s BBQ was inspired by my grandma, Bertha Mae Barker. 
            Who sadly passed away, September 13th, 2024. The house I was raised in is hers, over the years we’ve 
            had plenty of BBQs in the backyard. The week, I started my software-engineer program she passed away. When I found out about her passing, that Friday morning. I was extremely hurt behind it. In her honor I wanted to build a website, based on the amount BBQs we had over here. 
             And I wanted to name in after her, someone who was caring, loving dedicated to get things done and she would have a smile on her face. That’s what Bertha’s BBQ, is all about and my grandma represented that to the fullest. I love you grandma, thank you for everything.
